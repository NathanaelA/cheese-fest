# Cheese_Fest

A flutter version of the Cheese project.  

This is my first Flutter app; so it might be the worst Flutter example on the web.   Use it with a Grain of salt.    
The main source for flutter apps are in the "lib" folder; main.dart & child.dart files.

## Getting Started

You need to install flutter from http://flutter.io
